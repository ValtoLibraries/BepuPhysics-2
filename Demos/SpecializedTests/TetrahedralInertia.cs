                //Computing the inertia of a tetrahedron requires integrating across its volume.
                //While it's possible to do so directly given arbitrary plane equations, it's more convenient to integrate over a normalized tetrahedron with coordinates 
                //at (0,0,0), (1,0,0), (0,1,0), and (0,0,1). The integration location can be transformed back to the original frame of reference using the tetrahedral edges.
                //That is, (1,0,0) in normalized space transforms to B-A in world space.
                //To make that explicit, we have an equation:
                // [1,0,0]               [ B - A ]
                // [0,1,0] * Transform = [ C - A ]
                // [0,0,1]               [ D - A ]
                //(Note that you could consider this to be an affine transform with a translation equal to A.)

                //Since the normalized edge directions compose the identity matrix, the transform is just the edge directions.
                //So, given function f that computes a point's contribution to the inertia tensor, the inertia tensor of the normalized tetrahedron with uniform unit density is:
                //Integrate[Integrate[Integrate[f[{i, j, k}], {k, 0, 1-i-j}], {j, 0, 1-i}], {i, 0, 1}];
                //Note the integration bounds- they are a result of the simple shape of the normalized tetrahedron making the plane equations easier to deal with.
                //Now, to integrate over the true tetrahedron's shape, the normalized coordinates are transformed to world coordinates:
                //Integrate[Integrate[Integrate[f[{i, j, k}.Transform + A] * Abs[Det[Transform]], {k, 0, 1-i-j}], {j, 0, 1-i}], {i, 0, 1}];

                //One key difference is the inclusion of the transform's jacobian's determinant, which in this case is just the volume of the tetrahedron times six.
                //For a geometric intuition for why that exists, consider that the normalized integration covers a tetrahedron with a volume of 1/6. The world space tetrahedron
                //has a volume of Abs[Det[Transform]]/6. So, the volume changes by a factor of exactly Abs[Det[Transform]]. 
                //That term compensates for the difference in integration domain.
                //It's also constant over the integration, so you can just pull it out.
                //Similarly, if you had a non-unit uniform density, you would multiply the integration by it too.

                //So, putting that together and assuming the scaling term is pulled out, here's a chunk of code you can plop into wolfram cloud and whatnot to recreate the results:
                //f[{x_, y_, z_}] := {{y^2 + z^2, -x * y, -x * z}, {-x * y, x^2 + z^2, -y * z}, {-x * z, -y * z, x^2 + y^2}}
