# bepuphysics v2

This is the repo for the bepuphysics v2 library, a complete rewrite of the C# 3d rigid body physics engine [BEPUphysics v1](https://github.com/bepu/bepuphysics1).

*The library is still early in development. Many important features are missing, and many bugs likely remain. Nothing is guaranteed to build or be usable.*

You can keep an eye on incremental progress in the [issues](../../issues).
